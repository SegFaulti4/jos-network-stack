This repository contains our TCP/IP stack implementation.
All our files are located in the kern folder.
List of new files and their functions:
    * pci.h and pci.c - implementation of PCI device
        initialization and network card driver attach

    * e1000.h and e1000.c - implementation of network card driver and
        functions for transmit and recieve data.

    * ethernet.h and ethernet.c - implementation of ethernet protocol
        use functions from e1000.c to recieve and transmit data. The
        data is treated as an Ethernet frame structure. After parsing
        the ethernet frame, the data is transmitted either to the
        ip layer or to the arp response.

    * arp.h and arp.c - implementing an arp response to an arp request.

    * ip.h and ip.c - implementation of the ip layer. The data received
        from the underlying ethernet layer is treated as an ip packet, after which,
        depending on the destination, it is transmitted either to the UDP/TCP protocol
        for further transformations or to the ICMP protocol for echo response.

    * icmp.h and icmp.c - icmp echo response implementation.

    * udp.h and udp.c - implementation of recieving and transmitting udp datagrams.
